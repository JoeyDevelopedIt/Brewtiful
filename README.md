 Brewtiful is our first project. It utilizes multiple API's to help users find their closest Breweries and New Beers to try!
Brewtiful makes use of jQuery, BootStrap, Foundations, Firebase, two Google API's, BreweryDB API's and our hard work!
It features an index page where users can enter a zip code to genereate a list of breweries in a 5km radius. the index page also Lets users look through a limited selection of popular beer types to find new beers to try!
