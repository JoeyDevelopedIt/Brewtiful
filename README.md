Brewtiful is our first project. Brewtiful is an app that utilizes multiple API's to help users find their closest Breweries and new beers to try! Brewtiful makes use of jQuery, BootStrap, Foundations, Firebase, Google API's, BreweryDB API's and hard work. The app features an index page where users can enter a zip code to generate a list of breweries in a 5km radius. The index page also allows users look through a limited selection of popular beer types to find new ones to try!
